_The TALK in WINDARTTALK is Smalltalk: a live class library and IDE hosted
inside the Dart VM. Smalltalk source (`.mst` files) is compiled by a
front-end straight into the VM's flow-graph IR — the same intermediate
form Dart itself lowers to — and from there one JIT, one optimizer, and
one garbage collector serve both languages. One VM, bilingual._

(Headless, the Smalltalk side holds its own: the pinned benchmarks beat
Cog on six of seven, with deltablue at near-parity — that story is
[its own article](@/posts/optimizing-smalltalk-on-dart.md).)

When the ARM64 port reached the point of loading the Smalltalk world, the
working assumption — mine included — was that it wouldn't travel: the
world was authored on a Mac, against a Mac build, with classes named
`Cocoa`-this and game code written in Metal. The assumption did not
survive contact, and the ways it failed are the story.

## Source is the ultimate portable format

All 97 world files boot on Windows-on-ARM64 **byte-identical** — vendored
with per-file hash verification, no edits. 179 classes browse in the IDE
with their real source. Collections, Fractions, sorted collections,
streams, the benchmark dashboard: all of it runs.

![The bilingual class browser on Windows-on-ARM: 17 libraries, 182 classes, and the live Smalltalk source of STHostService in the pane — the stprim declarations that bridge Smalltalk methods to the host visible in the text](/images/smalltalk-on-a-snapdragon/bilingual-browser.png)

No magic; an architecture lesson. `.mst` is *source*. The front-end lowers
it to flow-graph IR, and machine dependence enters only below that line —
in the JIT backend the port already supplied. A class library written
against a VM's semantics, rather than against a platform, is host-neutral
by construction.

The genuinely platform-facing surface turned out smaller than anyone
guessed, and we only learned its true size by counting rather than
grepping. A first survey said "19 Cocoa-bound classes across 26 files need
porting" — an over-broad text match on the word "Cocoa," which also
matches the *library name* used on Windows and a pile of comments. The
real number, counted by which VM primitives the world requests versus
which the Windows side defines: **16 missing primitives, used by exactly
two files**. The `Cocoa*` UI classes needed *zero* — they were written
against pluggable hooks all along. Rule of thumb: measure your porting
surface; folklore overestimates it.

## The GUI nobody had to port

How does a Mac-authored Smalltalk UI class make windows on Win32? It
doesn't — and never did on the Mac either. The world's `AppUI` builds a
*description* of the interface and hands it through a primitive to a
**view server**: Smalltalk → a Dart hook → a batched message across the
embedder boundary → a C++ `ViewServer::Apply` that realizes native Win32
controls. On the Mac, the same description became AppKit. The Smalltalk
never knew, and still doesn't.

Old idea, still undefeated: the moment a UI is data rather than calls, the
platform is a rendering detail.

## Metal shaders on D3D11

The games were the entertaining part. `Galaxigans` — our Galaxians-alike —
draws its cosmos with a fragment shader written in **Metal Shading
Language**, because that is what the Mac's game pane spoke. The Windows
pane speaks HLSL through D3DCompile.

Rather than fork every game, the shader compiler grew a dialect shim:
`fract`→`frac`, `mix`→`lerp`, `inversesqrt`→`rsqrt`, two-argument
`atan`→`atan2`, plus a structural rewrite of the MSL entry point (the
`fragment float4 fmain(VOut in [[stage_in]], …)` signature becomes an HLSL
`SV_Target` function; attribute clutter stripped; the uniform-block prefix
dissolved). One translation deserves its own warning label: GLSL-family
`mod` is floor-based, HLSL's `fmod` truncates — **they differ in sign for
negative operands** — so `mod` maps to a small floor-mod helper, not to
the lookalike. Sign bugs in shaders don't crash; they just look subtly and
maddeningly wrong.

With the shim in place the Mac-authored shader runs unmodified, and
Galaxigans renders complete on the Adreno: starfield on layer 0, sprite
fleet, HUD, particles, sound.

## An IDE you can script from TCL

Debugging a live windowed IDE by clicking on it does not scale, so the
project drives everything through a control plane: the Dart VM's service
protocol — a WebSocket speaking JSON-RPC — with a TCL library over it.
Every battery test is a `tclsh` script: boot the IDE, import the world,
browse a class, run a game, screenshot the pane, assert on the bytes.
Claude runs the whole battery without touching the mouse, which is rather
the point. (The wider practice has
[its own article too](@/posts/tcl-for-agents.md).)

![The Find tab searching for "sqrt" across both languages at once: Dart's Float32x4.sqrt and Float64x2.sqrt beside Smalltalk's Number>>sqrt, Double>>sqrt and NativeFloatArray>>sqrtInto: — seven matches, one index](/images/smalltalk-on-a-snapdragon/find-across-languages.png)

Two pleasant Windows-on-ARM footnotes. First, no toolchain hunt: Git for
Windows quietly ships a **native arm64 tclsh**. Second, the scriptability
earned its keep immediately — the battery caught a VM abort in one
game-loading path and, run against both builds, proved it predated the
port rather than being caused by it. That is the sort of triage manual
clicking gets wrong.

## Where it lands

Add the earlier articles' work —
[comparisons at parity](@/posts/slow-mandelbrot.md), frames blitted
through [unified memory](@/posts/snapdragon-unified-memory.md) — and the
stack stands complete: a Smalltalk class library authored on a Mac,
compiled by a Dart VM's JIT to native ARM64, computing fractal frames
within 3% of hand-written Dart, writing pixels into memory the GPU reads
directly, inside an IDE a shell script can drive.

Nearly every layer of that sentence was, at some point, the thing we
assumed would not work.

*This closes the current arc. The open items — one arm64-only assert under
aggressive recompilation, and the 12% code-generation gap
[the emulator exposed](@/posts/racing-the-emulator.md) — are the next
one.*
