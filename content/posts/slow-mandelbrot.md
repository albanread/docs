_The bug report was mine, and brief: "the mandel zoom seems slow."
`MandelZoom` is the showcase demo — a Smalltalk class computing escape-time
fractals into a shared-memory framebuffer, 320×240 at up to 150 iterations
a pixel, roughly 11.5 million inner-loop iterations per frame. It was
managing about 22 fps on a machine with no business being that slow._

What follows is the investigation as it actually ran, wrong turns
included, because the wrong turns carry most of the lessons. It picks up
where [the Mac-side optimization story](@/posts/optimizing-smalltalk-on-dart.md)
left off — same hosted-Smalltalk architecture, new machine, new mystery.
The division of labour: Claude did the measuring and held the theories; I
supplied the scepticism.

## Hypothesis 1: boxed doubles. Wrong.

Smalltalk on a Dart VM sounds like a recipe for heap-allocated arithmetic,
so that was Claude's opening theory. I didn't believe it — *"dart is
excellent at floating point unboxing, there is something wrong"* — and the
benchmark suite agreed in one run: the `arith` workload, straight-line
float maths through the Smalltalk front-end, ran 11.7 ms — fourteen times
faster than the send-heavy `fib`. If doubles were boxing, `arith` would be
an allocation benchmark. It wasn't.

## Hypothesis 2: the GPU path. Wrong.

We had just rebuilt the upload path around
[unified memory](@/posts/snapdragon-unified-memory.md), so suspicion fell
there next. Measurement: compute a full frame with the two GPU calls
deleted. **44.3 ms of pure CPU compute** — against **8.4 ms** for
byte-identical maths written in plain Dart, same process, same VM. A 5.24×
gap with no GPU in sight.

## Hypothesis 3: the optimizer isn't running. Wrong — and usefully so.

Claude dumped the optimized IR for the hot method. The arithmetic was
beyond reproach: the four loop-carried variables lived in FP registers
across the back-edge (`phi … alive double`), every operation was an
unboxed `BinaryDoubleOp`, and the optimizer had even pattern-matched
`zr*zr` into a dedicated square operation. So much for hypothesis one,
again.

The tell sat two lines down. The loop's *comparisons* — `zr2 + zi2 < 4.0`
— compiled to: **box the double** (a heap allocation per iteration),
**call** `<` as a function, then compare the returned bool with `true`.
The maths travelled in registers; the comparisons went by post.

## Hypothesis 4: our condition lowering. Wrong.

Theory: the Smalltalk front-end materializes conditions as bool values and
defeats compare-and-branch fusion. To test it, Claude built the instrument
that should have existed from day one — **paired microbenchmarks**, each
workload written twice with identical semantics, Smalltalk and Dart:

| workload | ST/Dart |
|---|---|
| int compare loop | 1.01× |
| if/else in a loop | 1.01× |
| counted loop | 1.01× |
| **double compare loop** | **12.30×** |
| **loop bound in an instance variable** | **7.44×** |

A pure integer comparison loop at parity killed the lowering theory. Only
*double* comparisons were disastrous — and the IR held one more oddity:
the double compare site carried inline-cache entries for integer *and*
double, including an integer entry with a hit count of **zero**. Type
feedback from comparisons this code had never performed was somehow
poisoning it.

## The experiment that settled it

If the pollution comes from elsewhere, the same code in isolation should
be fast. It was:

    identical double-compare method, alone:     10.19 ms   (Dart parity)
    same method, in the full test suite:       126.95 ms

Then the minimal repro — four lines that explain everything:

    B1 double-loop  (run first)          10.25 ms   fine
    BS int-loop     (unrelated class)    25.04 ms   should be 3.4
    B2 double-loop  (identical to B1)   142.10 ms   14×
    B1 again                             10.27 ms   still fine

Performance was **order-dependent**. Whichever method the JIT optimized
first ran at full speed indefinitely; everything compiled afterwards was
quietly degraded. In a 97-file Smalltalk image, "afterwards" is nearly
everything.

## The cause: a helper that was tiny on purpose

The front-end routed the comparison operators through four small Dart
helpers — `stLess` and friends — deliberately tiny so the inliner would
always splice them into hot code. It did. But an inlined call site carries
the *helper's* type-feedback record, and there is exactly one `stLess` in
the image, so its record aggregates **every comparison of every type
anywhere**. Once it held both integer and double pairs, no site could
specialize — on arm64 the two cannot share an inline cache (a 62-bit
tagged integer does not fit a 53-bit mantissa) — and every comparison in
the image decayed to allocate, box, call.

The part I enjoyed least: the source file already *documented this exact
failure* for two earlier helpers, in comments, with measurements. The
comparison operators were simply the last survivors of the pattern. And
the one comparison the front-end had always emitted per-site rather than
through a helper — the counted-loop bound check — was the one comparison
benchmarking at parity all along. The evidence had been sitting there
being ignored, by machine and human alike.

## The fix that wasn't, then the one that was

Attempt one: keep the helpers for exotic operands and guard each site with
a class-id check. Correct, and no good: the guard cost integer-heavy code
2.4–3.9× and doubled `fib`. Rejected on measurement, which is the only
respectable way to reject a design.

The observation that unlocked the proper fix: **in optimized code, a
specialized comparison never executes the operator's method body at all** —
the JIT fuses it into a compare-and-branch. The body runs only in cold and
rare paths. So the one correctness case the helpers genuinely protected
(Smalltalk's `0 < (3/4)`, where Dart's integer `<` and the Smalltalk
Fraction each politely reverse the operands toward the other, indefinitely)
could be handled *inside the runtime library's operator body* — dead code
in every hot loop — by routing non-numeric arguments through coercion
hooks the Smalltalk bridge already had. Comparisons compile as plain
per-site operations everywhere; the reversal cycle is broken at its root;
no guard anywhere.

## The scoreboard

    ST vs Dart, before:   mean 3.75×, worst 12.30×
    ST vs Dart, after:    mean 1.01×, worst 1.03×
    MandelZoom frame:     37.1 ms → 8.6 ms
    Cog-bench suite:      flat — nothing regressed
    Correctness:          30/30, both reversal cycles included

A dynamically-dispatched Smalltalk, compiled through a Dart VM's JIT,
running double-heavy numeric code within 3% of hand-written Dart. We'll
take it.

## What we keep

1. **Measure before theorizing.** Five hypotheses died on contact with
   data. The paired benchmark took an hour to write and found in minutes
   what speculation had circled for days.
2. **Push back on your tools.** "Dart is excellent at unboxing" was the
   correct prior. Claude's job was to be wrong efficiently; mine was to
   say so early.
3. **Shared caches make performance non-local.** The unsettling property
   of this bug: running one benchmark changed the compiled speed of
   unrelated code. If a language funnels a hot operation through one
   shared helper, that helper's type feedback becomes a global variable.
4. **Write failures down where the next person trips.** The codebase
   warned about this pattern twice. The third instance survived anyway —
   but those comments are why recognizing it took minutes once the IR
   pointed there, rather than another round of theorizing.
